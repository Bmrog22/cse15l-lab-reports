TA response:

Info needed:

File structure: The code is in a folder by itself so you can just compile and run as normal using a bash script

Contents of file: Switch

to 

![Image](fixed.png)

How the bug was triggered: just by running the file as normal

What fixed the bug: to fix the bug, it is necessary to iterate through the list printing each element inside of it.
